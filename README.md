# RelicNewsForumArchive
Of late I have been reading and then downloading (as single, compiled HTML files*) all of the RelicNews Forum posts as provided on The Internet Archive WayBackMachine. As I am approaching the 2000th post (out of 7455 archived). I realized that this incredible fount of Homeworld 1 and Homeworld 2 knowledge and experience might be of interest to my fellow modders.

Unfortunately, I have heretofore downloaded the RelicNews Forum pages directly, hence they currently exist upon my machine in the order of their page names as opposed to their date of creation. I will seek to rectify this (soon) so that they may be downloaded by year.

*As downloaded HTML files the RelicNews Forums are easily searchable by keyword or phrase.
